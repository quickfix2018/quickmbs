MB's quick fill ballast system is designed for maximum capacity and ease of use.  With the flip of a switch you can fill up to 3,000 lbs. of ballast in under 60 seconds.  In 2016 we've added the option of plug and play system allowing an additional 1,600 lbs.  MB now offers the most factory ballast in the industry.
