Irv Brendel's "Hot Damn Hondo 006" broke records and won races in Long Beach
and Oakland. In fact they broke and set every record in NDBA, APBA and UMI
making history in the racing books; making them legends in their own time.
Mike was the driver of that boat and was elected to the Gulf Hall of Fame as a
result of those runs.
