It is the owner's responsibility to check the bolts on your wakeboard tower, speakers, racks and any other bolt-on accessories. This equipment absorbs a tremendous amount of energy traveling along the highway. The shoulder of the road is especially abusive to your boat; its components and your trailer. Please check you boat and trailer periodically.
