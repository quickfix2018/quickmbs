The first MB Sports boat, built by Mike and Irv Brendel along with a few
trusted partners. This boat was nicknamed "Kermit" because the gelcoat came
out such a bright green. It was built at a friend's farm near Merced, CA. Then
Irv, Mike, and Delbert Briscoe (Mike's father-in-law) towed it across the
country, for the WaterSki magazine test.
